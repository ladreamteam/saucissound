### Coding Standards

You should follow the coding standards from the language (and from the framework/technologies if needed).

### Branches

You should not work on the `master` branch. Every feature, fix or whatever should be done on a dedicated branch. For instance `feature-myawesomefeature` for a new feature named `my awesome feature` or `fix-318` for a fix about the issue #318.
